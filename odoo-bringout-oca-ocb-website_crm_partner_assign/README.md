# Resellers


This module allows to publish your resellers/partners on your website and to forward incoming leads/opportunities to them.


**Publish a partner**

To publish a partner, set a *Level* in their contact form (in the Partner Assignment section) and click the *Publish* button.

**Forward leads**

Forwarding leads can be done for one or several leads at a time. The action is available in the *Assigned Partner* section of the lead/opportunity form view and in the *Action* menu of the list view.

The automatic assignment is figured from the weight of partner levels and the geolocalization. Partners get leads that are located around them.
